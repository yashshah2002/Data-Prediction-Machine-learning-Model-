Predicting datasets
  
Books and courses are frustrating. They give you lots of recipes and snippets, but you never get to see how they all fit together.

When you are applying machine learning to your own datasets, you are working on a project.


The best way to really come to terms with a new platform or tool is to work through a machine learning project end-to-end and cover the key steps. Namely, from loading data, summarizing data, evaluating algorithms and making some predictions.

If you can do that, you have a template that you can use on dataset after dataset. You can fill in the gaps such as further data preparation and improving result tasks later, once you have more confidence.
